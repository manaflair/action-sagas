> Add extra capabilities to your action creators by allowing them to dispatch sagas

## Installation

```
$> npm install --save @manaflair/action-sagas
```

## Usage

```js
import { createSagaDispatcher }         from '@manaflair/action-sagas';
import { select, put }                  from 'redux-saga/effects';
import createSagaMiddleware }           from 'redux-saga';
import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from 'redux';

let sagaMiddleware = createSagaMiddleware();
let sagaDispatcher = createSagaDispatcher(sagaMiddleware);

let store = createStore(reducer, applyMiddleware(sagaDispatcher, sagaMiddleware));

store.dispatch(function * () {

    let counter = yield select(state => state.counter);

    yield put({ type: `SET_COUNTER`, value: counter + 1 });

});
```

## Why?

We felt like this approach could be a good way to customize an application by delegating some part of the logic to the action creator, instead of the application itself.

Note that because you can dispatch sagas doesn't mean that you should - doing so without consideration for the code architecture might contribute to make your code more difficult to understand and to maintain.

## Thanks

Most of this code has been originally designed by [Yassine Elouafi](https://github.com/yelouafi) on the [following thread](https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga/issues/123#issuecomment-189637424). We mainly packaged it into an easy-to-use module.
